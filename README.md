#### Testbench Waveform Analysis

Both my Moore and Mealy Shells are correct.  You can tell because the testbench waveforms showed the outputs responding
correctly to the inputs.  When the elevator was supposed to move up, the testbenches showed the elevator moving up, and
when the elevator was supposed to move down, the testbenches showed the elevator moving down.  I also know that my shells
are correct because my outputs for both testbenches read correctly at the correct times.


#### Debugging
For the first time, I honestly had no problems with a computer exercise.  It was quite the relief to be able to go through
and get it right on the first try.  It was actually a little scary right before i simulated my testbench because I could
not believe that it I was able to make it through something on VHDL with no errors.  Almost positive that I will not be able
to achieve this level of success on a computer exercise again.  This was fantastic.
